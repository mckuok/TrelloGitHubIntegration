## Overview

For our proposed project, we wanted to create an plugin for Eclipse IDE that would utilize Trello and GitHub APIs. Our reason for choosing to use Trello is because we felt it was similar to Kanban in a way of helping the developer when working in group projects. We chose GitHub as our remote repository because of its popularity in the software development field. In addition to this, we will also incorporate a Pomodoro timer to the plugin that will keep track of the time while the developer is working.

## Libraries

* Jackson (http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for converting Java class object from and to JSON String.
